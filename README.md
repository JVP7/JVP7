--------
I‚Äôm an Information Systems major with a minor in Computer Science at The University of Akron, working towards a career in AI/ML and software engineering.

I‚Äôm building my skills in Python, C++, and SQL, while exploring machine learning, software development, and data analysis. I enjoy applying what I learn through hands-on projects and continuously improving my coding and technical foundations.

My goal is to pursue a master‚Äôs degree in Machine Learning after completing my undergraduate studies, and to further specialize in applied AI/ML development. In the meantime, I‚Äôm gaining experience through an internship, personal projects, and certifications.

Always learning ‚Äî always building.
